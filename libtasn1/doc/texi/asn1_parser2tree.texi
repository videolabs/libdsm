@deftypefun {int} {asn1_parser2tree} (const char * @var{file}, asn1_node * @var{definitions}, char * @var{error_desc})
@var{file}: specify the path and the name of file that contains
ASN.1 declarations.

@var{definitions}: return the pointer to the structure created from
"file" ASN.1 declarations.

@var{error_desc}: return the error description or an empty
string if success.

Function used to start the parse algorithm.  Creates the structures
needed to manage the definitions included in  @code{file} file.

@strong{Returns:} @code{ASN1_SUCCESS}  if the file has a correct syntax and every
identifier is known, @code{ASN1_ELEMENT_NOT_EMPTY}  if  @code{definitions} not
@code{NULL} , @code{ASN1_FILE_NOT_FOUND}  if an error occured while
opening  @code{file} , @code{ASN1_SYNTAX_ERROR}  if the syntax is not
correct, @code{ASN1_IDENTIFIER_NOT_FOUND}  if in the file there is an
identifier that is not defined, @code{ASN1_NAME_TOO_LONG}  if in the
file there is an identifier whith more than @code{ASN1_MAX_NAME_SIZE} 
characters.
