@deftypefun {int} {asn1_number_of_elements} (asn1_node @var{element}, const char * @var{name}, int * @var{num})
@var{element}: pointer to the root of an ASN1 structure.

@var{name}: the name of a sub-structure of ROOT.

@var{num}: pointer to an integer where the result will be stored

Counts the number of elements of a sub-structure called NAME with
names equal to "?1","?2", ...

@strong{Returns:} @code{ASN1_SUCCESS}  if successful, @code{ASN1_ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND}  if
 @code{name} is not known, @code{ASN1_GENERIC_ERROR}  if pointer  @code{num} is @code{NULL} .
