* Noteworthy changes in release 4.8 (released 2016-04-11) [stable]
- Fixes to avoid reliance on C undefined behavior.
- Fixes to avoid an infinite recursion when decoding without
  the ASN1_DECODE_FLAG_STRICT_DER flag. Reported by Pascal Cuoq.
- Combined all the BER octet string decoding functions to a single
  one based on asn1_decode_simple_ber().

* Noteworthy changes in release 4.7 (released 2015-09-14) [stable]
- Fixed regression introduced in the decoding of multi-byte tags
  fix.

* Noteworthy changes in release 4.6 (released 2015-09-05) [stable]
- Allow decoding OCTET STRINGs with multi-byte tags.
- API and ABI changes since last version:
  asn1_get_object_id_der: New function

* Noteworthy changes in release 4.5 (released 2015-04-29) [stable]
- Corrected an invalid memory access in octet string decoding.
  Reported by Hanno Böck.

* Noteworthy changes in release 4.4 (released 2015-03-29) [stable]
- Corrected a two-byte stack overflow in asn1_der_decoding. Reported
  by Hanno Böck.

* Noteworthy changes in release 4.3 (released 2015-03-09) [stable]
- Added asn1_decode_simple_ber()

* Noteworthy changes in release 4.2 (released 2014-09-15) [stable]
- Added sanity checks in the decoding of time when
  ASN1_DECODE_FLAG_STRICT_DER is used.
- Fixes in the decoding of OCTET STRING when close to the end
  of the structure.

* Noteworthy changes in release 4.1 (released 2014-08-23) [stable]
- Corrected indefinite tag check in ANY constructions. That allows
  the decoding of BER-encoded structures that contain indefinite
  encoding within an ANY element.
- Added DER decoding flag ASN1_DECODE_FLAG_STRICT_DER. Over the
  years BER functionality was added to the decoder and this flag
  provides the way to disable it.
- API and ABI changes since last version:
  ASN1_DECODE_FLAG_STRICT_DER: New definition

* Noteworthy changes in release 4.0 (released 2014-06-26) [stable]
- Optimized asn1_der_decoding_startEnd(). It no longer requires the
  additional decoding step.
- asn1_read_value() understands the ?CURRENT keyword, which can be used
  to indicate the current element of a sequence, when the provided node
  is a sequence element.
- Several optimizations in DER decoding of structures with sequences
  containing many elements.
- asn1_der_decoding2() is introduced and allows flags to be passed on
  the decoding process. Currently only ASN1_DECODE_FLAG_ALLOW_PADDING is
  defined and that allows decoding DER structures that contain arbitrary
  data past their end. Contributed by Karel Slany.
- API and ABI changes since last version:
  ASN1_DECODE_FLAG_ALLOW_PADDING: New definition
  asn1_dup_node: New function
  asn1_der_decoding2: New function
  asn1_der_decoding_element: It is now an alias to asn1_der_decoding

  asn1_der_decoding() instead.

  of all values in the structure prior to deinitialization.
- The parser accepts negative numbers in an INTEGER range (but
  still does no enforce them).

* Noteworthy changes in release 3.3 (released 2013-03-23) [stable]
- More precise overflow checks using gnulib's intprops module.
- Updates to compile in Android systems.

  ASN1_ARRAY_TYPE -> asn1_static_node (was asn1_static_node_t)
- Added new types: VisibleString, NumericString, IA5String, TeletexString,
  PrintableString, UniversalString, BMPString, UTF8String. When re-defined
  a warning is being print instead of failing.
- Parser outputs more detailed syntax error messages.
- Added asn1_decode_simple_der() and asn1_encode_simple_der().
- Added asn1_read_value_type() to return value and type.

  ASN1_TYPE -> asn1_node
  ASN1_TYPE_EMPTY -> NULL
  static_struct_asn -> asn1_static_node_st
  node_asn_struct -> asn1_node_st
